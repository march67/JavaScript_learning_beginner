# JavaScript_learning_beginner
In this repository you will find the projects I made with the documentation in french to learn JavaScript from scratch in autodictate.

As a beginner I will probably make mistakes with the licences, please note that all the projects in that repository I merely meant to show my progression / learning curve. It is not my wish to break the law so if you have any feedback about it please contact me so I can correct my mistakes.
